.Nm lazyglpk-config
.Nd Helper program to configure lazylpsolverlibs to work with glpk
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lazyglpk-config
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program tries to solve a linear program with glpk. Success indicates
that the solver is correctly configured to work with lazylpsolverlibs.
Failure indicates that the solver was not found or could not be interacted
with. In case of failure, consider re-running this command with the
environment variable LAZYLPSOLVERLIBS_DEBUG set to be non empty.
lazylpsolverlibs will automatically look for the solver library in
standard paths. The search can be influenced by setting an environment
variable (see ENVIRONMENT), or via a symbolic link (see FILES).
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables are used.
.Bl -tag -width ".." -compact
.Pp
.It Cm LAZYLPSOLVERLIBS_GLPK_LIB
Interpreted as the full path to glpk library.
.Pp
.It Cm LAZYLPSOLVERLIBS_DEBUG
If non empty, enables debug output on stdout.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".." -compact
.Pp
.It Cm /usr/local/lib/libglpk.so
This file is always checked first as a candidate for glpk library. It
takes precedence over the variable LAZLPSOLVERLIBS_GLPK_LIB. You should
symlink this file to the actual solver library.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The exit status is 0 if the solver is correctly configured and 1 otherwise.
