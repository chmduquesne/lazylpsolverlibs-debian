About dpkg-shlibdeps warnings
-----------------------------
Dpkg-shlibdeps complains about useless linking against libpthread.so.0 and
libm.so.6, claiming they use none of their symbols. While the former
statement is true, the linking is _not_ useless and was enforced upstream.
The reason is that the commercial solver libraries are not necessarily
well packaged: they do not always specify the libraries they need in
DT_NEEDED. In order to avoid runtime errors because of missing symbols,
lazylpsolverlibs loads these libraries for them.
