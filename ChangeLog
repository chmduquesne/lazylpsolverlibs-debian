version 0.0.3:
    - Added proper windows support with an installer
    - Added a way to force the library to load with environment variables
    - Added a check for known versions of libraries
    - Backward compatibility note:
        This version *breaks* the backward compatibility by changing the
        names of some headers. If you were previously using
        lazylpsolverlibs and this annoys you, drop me an email
        (<chmd@chmd.fr>). I'll be happy to introduce backward
        compatible headers. Because right now I don't think anyone uses
        this library, I am taking the risk not to add these backward
        compatible headers for the sake of simplicity...
        Header renaming: lazy_gurobi_c.h -> lazygurobi.h
        Header renaming: lazy_cplex.h -> lazycplex.h
        Header renaming: lazy_xprs.h -> lazyxprs.h
        Header renaming: lazy_glpk.h -> lazyglpk.h
